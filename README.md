This is a demo project.<b>I'm using react-final-form and redux.</b>It's a streaming platform.
First you clone the repository then you will have to use npm install and npm start 3 times to actually make the page fully functional.First run npm install and then npm start inside the api folder. Then do the same in the rtmpserver folder! And then run npm install and npm start on the main folder!
Have fun!
