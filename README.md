This is a demo project.
<b>I'm using react-final-form and redux.</b> It's a streaming platform.
First you clone the repository then you will have to use npm install and npm start 3 times to actually make the page fully functional.
First run npm install and then npm start inside the api folder. 
Repeat the commands in the rtmpserver folder!
And repeat them again on the main folder!
Have fun!
